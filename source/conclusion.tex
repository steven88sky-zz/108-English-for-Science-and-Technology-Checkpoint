\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this paper, we have presented HANDIO, a wireless
hybrid hand gesture recognition system of OMTS and ACC.
Compared with previous works, the proposed system strikes
the most balance among gesture variety, wearability, and power
consumption. The OMTS enables the detection of wrist movements,
which greatly increases the total number of detectable
gestures of the current single ACC-based HSG.

In addition to the hardware, we also describe a DTW
and decision fusion-based detection algorithm, which shows
a high detection rate. By fusing the MTS and ACC signals,
the system response time is also significantly improved. We
also show that the same system can be used in many other
body-area sensor applications. Altogether we are building the
next-generation, highly wearable sensor networks for accurate
human movement monitoring and tracking.
