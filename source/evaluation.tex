\section{EVALUATION}
\subsection{Detection Accuracy}
We tested our HGR system on three subjects, two male
and one female. One important aspect of HGR is the noise
rejection. In real situations, gestures coexist with random
activities. These random activity should be rejected instead of
being recognized as a valid gesture. Otherwise, the system will
become hard to use due to many false positives. We collected
40 non-gesture noise patterns, including random hand or wrist
shake with both short and long wrist activities from each
subject. Another 40 samples of each gesture from each person
are also record. The total collection time is over 1 hour each.
The system is implemented on a laptop computer to repeatedly
study the data. The detection rate is defined in Eq. (3).

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{equation}
Detection\_Rate = 1-\frac{True\_Negatives+False\_Positives}{Total\_Gestures}
\end{equation}
\end{footnotesize}

As shown in Table I, the detection rate is over 93$\%$ with the
highest over 95$\%$. We also implemented a single ACC-based
HGR with the sliding window algorithm. A threshold is set to
reject the noise based on the DTW score. The result clearly
indicates that our system is superior to single ACC-based
system in terms of noise rejection and detection accuracy.

The detailed result for each gesture is shown in Table II.
The detection rate is just the true positive rate, since no noise
gesture is involved. Even though for some gestures, ACConly
results in slightly higher detection rate than the fusion
method does, the fusion method helps improve the accuracy
of the majority at a very small cost. The overall result shows
the advantage of decision fusion over the single ACC-based
method. The same gesture is usually done multiple times with
different stopping points or angles to record multiple templates
for each gesture. This multi-template setting helps eliminate
ambiguity. Fig. 10 shows the influence of the weight $\gamma$ in
Eq. (2). The detection rates for all three people go beyond
93$\%$ when $\gamma$ = 66$\%$.

\subsection{Power Consumption}
The power consumption of the system is measured using a
current probe. The current values are integrated over a period
of 5 minutes to calculate the average power consumption.
Fig. 11 shows the periodic current signal of the optical sensor
board. Even though the LED takes around 500$\mu$A when
turned on, the duty of PWM is around 1.25$\%$. The optical
sensor consumes around 258$\mu$W on average. The majority
of the power is consumed by BLE communication sending
and receiving data. The average power consumption of the
CC2541 and MPU-9250 is around 57.5 mW. Thus, the power
consumption increased by the MTS is only around 0.4$\%$ of
the system power. The current system can last for more than 6
hours without recharging. Further optimization for future work
includes lowering the SoC`s Tx power, adjusting the sampling
rate, and enabling threshold detection in the accelerometer.

\subsection{Time Delay}
The recognition system has also been ported to an
iPhone4s. The measured computation delay is around 50 ms
in the worst case with an average of 14 ms. Even with an
expansion of around 30 gestures, the delay is under 100 ms.

\subsection{Other Applications}
We also tested the system on elbow and knee joints. The
sensing locations are shown in Fig. 12. Signal samples are
shown in Fig. 13. The degree of freedom of movement is
generally less than the wrist joint. The MTS signal can be
used to detect the muscle movement around the joint while
the ACC data provides the detailed movement, such as moving
direction, timing, etc. The fusion of both MTS and ACC can
be synergistic in classifying the movements.
