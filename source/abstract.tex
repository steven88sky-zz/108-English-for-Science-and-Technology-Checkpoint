This paper describes a miniature, wearable wireless
hand-gesture recognition (HGR) system called HANDIO. It ob-
tains its input from not only traditional inertial sensors but also
a muscle tension sensor (MTS). The addition of MTS enables
recognition of a much broader range of intuitive hand gestures,
particularly those involving the wrist, that would otherwise
be difficult to distinguish by traditional inertial-only HGRs.
Among MTSs, we choose an optical MTS over the conventional
surface electromyography (sEMG) for the small size, low power
consumption, wearing comfort, and good detection rate. This
novel miniaturized design enables the whole system to be easily
patched on the wrist area or integrated into a wearable device
such as a wristband or watch without extra wiring. Experimental
results show that a total of 8 hand gestures involving the wrist can
be recognized with a detection rate over 93$\%$. The average power
consumption of the optical sensor is only around 258$\mu$W. This
versatile system can also be used to detect other joint activities
such as the elbow and knee joint.
